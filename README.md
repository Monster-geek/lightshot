# Lightshot Filename Path Disclosure (POC)

This proof of concept shows how lightshot screenshot hosting service can be easily crawled without any restriction.  
This weakness was first discovered by [Na√Øm GALLOUJ](https://www.naimo.me/).  
Script Author : Charles SENGES (me, btw).

## Usage

```bash
$  ./pull.sh <url> <number of level>
```

* URL : Your startig point
* Levels : How much you want to crawl the url. (See exemples)

## Exemples

```bash
$  ./pull.sh https://prnt.sc/abc123 1
```  
  
Will go from `https://prnt.sc/abc120` to `https://prnt.sc/abc12z`  
Could also be seen as `https://prnt.sc/abc12*`  
  
In the same way :  
  
```bash
$  ./pull.sh https://prnt.sc/abc123 6
```

Could be seend as `https://prnt.sc/******`
The script would then crawl the whole website (could be long if you don't have a quantum computer (I know quantum computer wouldn't help but.. come on))
