# Lightshot Filename Path Disclosure (POC)

This proof of concept shows how lightshot screenshot hosting service can be easily crawled without any restriction.  
This weakness was first discovered by Na√Øm GALLOUJ.  
Script Author : Charles SENGES (me, btw).

## Usage

`$  ./pull.sh <url> <number of level>`

* URL : Your startig point
* Levels : How much you want to crawl the url. (See exemples)

## Exemples

`$  ./pull.sh https://prnt.sc/abc123 1`  
  
Will go from "https://prnt.sc/abc120" to "https://prnt.sc/abc12z"  
Could also be seen as "https://prnt.sc/abc12*"  
  
In the same way :  
  
`$  ./pull.sh https://prnt.sc/abc123 6`

Could be seend as "https://prnt.sc/******"
The script would then crawl the whole website (could be long if you don't have a quantum computer btw (I know quantum computer wouldn't help but.. come on))
